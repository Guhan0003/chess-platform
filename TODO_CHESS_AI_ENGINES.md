# ðŸ§  Multi-Engine Chess AI Architecture - TODO

## ðŸŽ¯ Rating-Based Engine Hierarchy

Build **ELO-rated bots** that players can relate to:

| Engine | ELO Rating | Personality | Key Features |
|--------|------------|-------------|--------------|
| **Rookie** | 400-600 | Makes obvious blunders | Random moves 30%, basic tactics |
| **Club Player** | 800-1000 | Inconsistent but learning | Simple patterns, occasional tactics |
| **Tournament** | 1200-1400 | Solid fundamentals | Opening principles, tactical awareness |
| **Master** | 1600-1800 | Strategic thinking | Positional understanding, endgames |
| **Grandmaster** | 2000-2200 | Near-perfect play | Deep calculation, advanced theory |
| **Stockfish Lite** | 2400+ | Engine-level | Maximum strength for challenges |

## ðŸš€ Adaptive AI System Ideas

### 1. Dynamic Rating Adjustment
- [ ] Engines adapt based on player performance
- [ ] If player wins 3 games â†’ bump engine rating +100
- [ ] Personalized difficulty curve

### 2. Personality-Driven Play Styles
- [ ] **Aggressive Bot**: Loves tactics, sacrifices
- [ ] **Positional Bot**: Slow, strategic buildup
- [ ] **Endgame Specialist**: Weak opening, strong endings
- [ ] **Blitz Master**: Fast, intuitive moves
- [ ] **Classical Player**: Deep, calculated decisions

### 3. Learning & Memory System
- [ ] Bots remember your playing style
- [ ] Adapt to exploit your weaknesses
- [ ] "This player always falls for pins..." analysis

### 4. Themed Engines ðŸŽ­
- [ ] **Sicilian Dragon Expert**: Specialist in specific openings
- [ ] **Tactical Genius**: Puzzle-solving focused
- [ ] **Endgame Teacher**: Educational, explains moves
- [ ] **Historical Masters**: Play like Capablanca, Fischer, etc.

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Strategy

```
Engine Architecture:
â”œâ”€â”€ Base Engine (minimax + alpha-beta) âœ… DONE
â”œâ”€â”€ Rating Modulator (adjusts search depth/evaluation)
â”œâ”€â”€ Personality Layer (move selection bias)
â”œâ”€â”€ Learning Module (player pattern recognition)
â””â”€â”€ Opening Books (rating-appropriate repertoire)
```

## ðŸ’¡ Smart Features

### 1. Progressive Training Mode
- [ ] Start at your level, gradually increase
- [ ] "Your chess coach" - explains mistakes

### 2. Analysis Integration
- [ ] Post-game analysis with engine commentary
- [ ] "Stockfish would play differently here..."

### 3. Challenge Modes
- [ ] "Beat the 1500 bot in under 20 moves"
- [ ] "Survive 10 moves against 2200 bot"
- [ ] Daily puzzle challenges

### 4. Multiplayer Tournament Bots
- [ ] Bots participate in tournaments
- [ ] Create rating ladders: Human vs AI mixed

## ðŸŒŸ Advanced Ideas

### 1. Neural Network Integration
- [ ] Train on player games
- [ ] Hybrid traditional + ML approach

### 2. Opening Preparation
- [ ] Bots with limited opening knowledge by rating
- [ ] 400 bot: Random moves
- [ ] 2000 bot: Deep theoretical knowledge

### 3. Time Management AI
- [ ] Lower-rated bots think faster (realistic)
- [ ] Higher-rated bots use time wisely

### 4. Mistake Injection System
- [ ] Deliberately inject human-like errors
- [ ] Rating-appropriate blunder frequency

## ðŸŽ® User Experience

### Player Dashboard Features
- [ ] **"Find Your Level"** â†’ Auto-rating assessment
- [ ] **"Daily Challenge"** â†’ Beat today's featured bot
- [ ] **"Training Mode"** â†’ Progressive difficulty
- [ ] **"Puzzle Rush"** â†’ Tactical bot challenges
- [ ] **"Custom Match"** â†’ Pick any rating level

## ðŸ’° Monetization Ideas

- [ ] **Premium Bots**: Access to 2000+ rated engines
- [ ] **Analysis Pro**: Deep post-game breakdowns
- [ ] **Custom Personalities**: Create your own bot style
- [ ] **Tournament Mode**: Compete in mixed human/AI events

## ðŸ“‹ Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Core Rating System
- [ ] Implement 4 basic rating levels (400, 800, 1200, 1600)
- [ ] Adjust search depth based on rating
- [ ] Basic evaluation function tuning

### Phase 2: Personality Layer
- [ ] Add move selection bias
- [ ] Implement playing style variations
- [ ] Mistake injection system

### Phase 3: Advanced Features
- [ ] Learning and adaptation
- [ ] Opening book integration
- [ ] Analysis and coaching features

### Phase 4: Premium Features
- [ ] Neural network integration
- [ ] Historical master personalities
- [ ] Tournament and challenge modes
